Pre-processed 1000 suggestions (made by citizens at www.mygov.in website) by applying syntax and semantic processing operations using nltk in python.  Categorized the suggestions using scikit-learn in python and weka. Build a text classifier that analyses the top 750 suggestions and then using the trained results predicts the results for the next 250 suggestions.

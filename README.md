# Mann-Ki-Baat-Data-Analysis
Goals:
(1) Pre-process the suggestions(made by citizens at www.mygov.in website) by applying syntax and semantic processing operations (perform as many of them as possible) in the context of NLP. 
[Hint: Use nltk in python]
(2) Categorize the suggestions, do this categorization using two broad approaches. 
[Hint: Use scikit-learn in python or use Weka]
a) Clustering: Perform k-means clustering on the suggestions and categorize suggestions into k clusters.
b) Classification: Manually annotate latest 1000 suggestions into various classes, use 750 suggestions as 'training' and rest as 'test'. For classifiers, use knn, naive bayes, random forest and svm.

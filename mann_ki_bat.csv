Normally a parsad feels that she is a great one and why she should go among people. If this is done then local issues can be resolved and state govt. can function better. CM cannot go to all cities individually. Best Regards Neeraj Sin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many people have little faith that they'd get justice from this system. And so they resort to their own mode of justice like lynching of thieves, keeping FDs as deposit to provide Health Care and doing all things legal-illegal that will ensure them justice is being made
